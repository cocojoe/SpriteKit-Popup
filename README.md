#Pet Peril
iOS, Swift, Objective-C, Cocos2D, Xcode 7.3.1.

Fun little game concept that I couldn't find time for.  Rather than banish it to the archives of my QNAP, I thought it
would be nice to share the source. #gamedev

##Build

I've added assets to the repository as most people probably do not have SpriteBuilder installed to publish the sprite sheets and other supporting assets. This way you do not need any extra tools and the game should run straight up in Xcode 7.3.1 (TESTED).  
The game uses shaders so expect simulator performance to be zero, solid 60 on device.

##Disclaimer

I havn't cleaned the code up or ever expected anyone to ever look at the source :]  
I designed it for iPhone 5 at the time, if it works nicely on other devices that's a bonus.
